# Finite_Element_Method_in_Electromagnetic

### This Project is made for the last homework of the  Electromagnetic Modelling Lecture.

In the main function, there should be two matrix one for the initial values of the Finite element nodes and other for specifying the Region of Work. In the RegionOfWork matrix the boundary conditions should be assigned as 2 and all other nodes should be assigned as 1. The garbage values (which are not interested) in the matrix should be assigned as 0.
